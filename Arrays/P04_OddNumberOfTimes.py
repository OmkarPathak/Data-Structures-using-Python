# Given an array of positive integers. All numbers occur even number of times except one
# number which occurs odd number of times. Find the number in O(n) time & constant space.

# XOR of all elements gives us odd occurring element. Please note that XOR of two elements
# is 0 if both elements are same and XOR of a number x with 0 is x.

# NOTE: This will only work when there is only one number with odd number of occurences.

def print_odd_occurences(array):
    odd = 0

    for element in array:
        # XOR with the odd number
        odd = odd ^ element

    return odd
